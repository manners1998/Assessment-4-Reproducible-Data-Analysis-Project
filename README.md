# Assessment-4-Reproducible-Data-Analysis-Project

This repository is to host an analysis project which is set out to identify the best starting 5 players for the Chicago Bulls. The Bulls have a salary of $118 million, however there must also be enough payroll leftover for the reamining bench / rotational players. 

### Aim of the Data Analysis Project 
As the data analyst for the Chicago Bulls a basketball team in the National Basketball Assosociation (NBA) I have been put in charge of analysising season 2018-2019 data to find a ideal effective starting 5. Within season 2018-2019 the Bulls place 27th out of 30 with a win loss record of 22 and 60 respectively. The budget the Bulls have for the upcoming season is $118 million, ranked 26th out of 30. For refrence, the team with the highest budget is the Portland Trailbalzers ($148 million) and the best performing team from the 2018-2019 season the Milwaukee Bucks ($131 million). 

The General Manager of the Bulls has tasked me to find the best available starting 5 players (one from each position. It also has to be mentioned that there must still be remaining money to fill the remaining team roster.
